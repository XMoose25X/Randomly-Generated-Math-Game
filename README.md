## How it works.
Instruction are included once you launch the site. However the premise is pretty straight forward...
- There are a series of 10 randomly-generated math problems presented to you.
- You have 10 seconds to answer with either 0-9 on the keyboard or on-screen buttons.
- You will be prompted by a green light for a correct answer and a red light for a wrong answer.
- A final score will be shown once all 10 questions have been answered.

### Tips
- All operands will be between 0-25.
- Division only occurs when there is no remainder.
- Multiplication only occurs when one of the two numbers is between 0-10.
- Answers will always be between 0-9.

## How it was made.
This project is made entirely in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. It also used Bootstrap and jQuery to make things easier. It generates an equation with three operands, two operators, and one set of parentheses. All numbers are positive whole numbers and the answer is always between 0-9. The user will  be able to input this on a keyboard or select from the on-screen number pad. The problems are randomly generated using a simple homemade algorithm.
